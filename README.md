Snaaake
=======

A simple snake clone with some changes. 
- Movement isn't limited to 90 degree angles, there's a whole new frontier of 45 degrees!
- Simple AI enemies that will chase you and try to eat your tail
- No walls (yet?)

Requirements
=======
LÃ¶ve2D 0.8.0 or later (shaders not supported yet)

Upcoming Features/Bug TODO
=======
- Color transitions are buggy and not at all pretty
- Bloom/Lighting shaders for snake and powerups
- Remove attached console
- 2 additional powerups
- More levels
